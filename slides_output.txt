The Pharmaceutical  Problem  Nobody  Talks About
Mass balance  (MB) in forced  degradation  is foundational  ΓÇö yet fails 
far too often.
Investigations  waste time, delay releases,  and cost millions  when MB 
doesnΓÇÖt  add up.
Ironically,  we rely on methods  that ignore  real chemistry.
Metaphor:  ΓÇ¥Mass  balance  is like pharmaΓÇÖs  bad Wi-Fi ΓÇö flaky, unreliable, 
and everyoneΓÇÖs  blaming  the router  (detector).ΓÇ¥

Real-World  Consequences  of Poor Mass Balance
Regulatory  Risk:  ICH Q1A(R2)  expects  100% mass balance ΓÇö 
missing  10% can trigger  full investigations.
Time  Lost:  Investigations  can delay batch release  by 2ΓÇô6 weeks. 
Costly  Detours:  $100k+  spent on root cause analysis,  stress study 
repeats, and justifications.
Reputation:  MB issues  create audit flags and internal  friction 
between  R&D, QA, and manufacturing.

Why Existing  MB Methods  Fail
SMB  ΓÇô Simple  Mass  Balance : Based  only on purity  and total 
degradants . Ignores  UV response  factors  and molecular  weights . 
Over-simplified .
AMB  ΓÇô Absolute  Mass  Balance : Measures  all peaks  by area. 
Misses  UV-invisible  degradants . No stoichiometric  awareness .
RMB  ΓÇô Relative  Mass  Balance : Assumes  equal detectability . 
Overreacts  to low-degradation  scenarios .

LK-IMB: Making  Mass Balance  Chemistry -Aware
Problem:  Traditional  MB ignores  detector  bias (RRF)  and molecular 
weight  differences.
LK-IMB Solution:  Introduces  correction  using two key factors:
╬╗i ΓÇô Relative  response  factor  (RRF)  correction
╧ëi ΓÇô Molecular weight  (MW)  ratio of degradant/API
Corrects  degradant  contributions  before  summing  them in MB. 
Enables  more chemically  honest  MB calculations.

LK-IMB in Action
Realistic  scenario:  A degradant  shows  7.2
Traditional  AMB would  overestimate  its contribution  ΓåÆ 7.2 
LK-IMB corrects  this: 7.2% ├ù 0.5 ├ù 1.2 = 4.32%.
Prevents  false OOS results  and unnecessary  investigations.
Key Impact:  LK-IMB separates  true degradation  risk from detector 
illusion.ΓÇö-Same  Data  , Smarter  Math

Building  Forward:  CIMB Framework
Problem:  Even LK-IMB is limited  ΓÇö it lacks uncertainty  modeling 
and decision  logic.
CIMB  = LK-IMB + Statistical  Rigor
Adds:
Confidence  intervals  around  MB estimates 
Risk-based  acceptance  thresholds
Scenario -sensitive  correction  (S-factors,  thresholds)
CIMB transforms  mass balance  from a fixed to a flexible,  defensible 
confidence  zone.

Confidence  Interval -Based  Mass Balance
Traditional  MB gives a single number  :zero info on reliability
CIMB introduces  statistical  uncertainty  via confidence  intervals  (CI).
Method:
Use Gaussian  error propagation  or Monte  Carlo simulations  (e.g., 
10,000  trials)
Account  for variability  in assay, impurities,  RRF, MW ratios
Output:  A range ΓÇö e.g., CIMB = 96.3%  ┬▒ 1.8% (95% CI)
Impact:  Differentiates  real imbalance  from method  noise;  improves 
regulatory  defensibility.

--- Page 15 ---
ROC-Optimized  Confidence  Thresholds
Instead  of arbitrary  cutoffs  (like MB ΓëÑ 95%),  CIMB++  uses 
data-driven  thresholds  based on ROC analysis.
Process:
Plot true positive  vs. false positive rates across  MB confidence  intervals 
Find optimal  threshold  balancing  sensitivity  (detecting  real issues)  and 
specificity  (avoiding  false alarms)  for smarter,  risk-based  quality triggers
Example:  You may choose  to flag MB less than 92.7%  only if CI 
width  more than 2.5%

--- Page 16 ---
Bayesian  Updating  for Method  Trust Over Time
Initial  MB assessments  may have wide uncertainty  ΓÇö but confidence 
improves  with repeated data.
CIMB++  incorporates  Bayesian  updating  to refine CI with new study 
results.
How  it works:
Start with a prior distribution  based on early study 
Update  the belief as more degradation  batches are tested 
Posterior  becomes  sharper  ΓåÆ narrower  CI ΓåÆ more trust
Ideal for lifecycle methods  and long-term tracking  across  batches.

--- Page 17 ---
Stoichiometry -Aware  Correction  (S-Factor)
Many  degradants  gain or lose atoms  during  stress (e.g., hydrolysis 
adds water,  decarboxylation  loses CO2).
The S-Factor  accounts  for mass shift from the original  API.
Formula:
API stress  + ╬ú Di ┬╖ ╬╗i ┬╖ ╧ëi ┬╖ SiCIMB = ├ù 100API initial
Si adjusts  for stoichiometric  contribution  of each degradant. 
Prevents  over- or under-estimation  in reactions  involving  mass 
exchange.

Predictive  Degradation  Modeling
Use AI/ML  or expert  systems  (e.g., Zeneth,  DEREK  Nexus)  to 
predict  likely degradants  before  stress testing.
Input:  API structure  + stress type (acid, base, peroxide,  photolysis) 
Output:  Predicted  degradant  structures  with MW, volatility,  UV 
activity
Benefits:
Plan detection  methods  proactively  (ELSD,  MS, etc.)
Pre-fill MW ratios (╧ëi ) and anticipate  UV-invisible species 
Reduce  trial-and-error in stress method development
on Team:  aarav.singla  (Novartis  NEST  Hackath CIMB++  Final Presentation February  2026 19 / 36

--- Page 20 ---
Hybrid  Detection  Integration
Not all degradants  are UV-active  ΓÇö traditional  methods  miss volatile, 
neutral,  or low chromophore  species.
CIMB++  supports  hybrid  detection  using:
UV (for chromophores)
ELSD (evaporative  light scattering  detector  ΓÇö for non-UV species) 
MS (mass  spectrometry  ΓÇö for trace/unknown  degradants)
Multi-detector  integration improves  coverage  and reduces  false low 
MB.
System  reconciles detector  outputs  using peak alignment and 
quantitation  logic.

Cascade  Degradation  Network  Modeling  (DAG-MB)

Model  degradation as a Directed 
Acyclic  Graph  (DAG)
How  it works:
API and degradants  represented  as 
nodes
Mass tracked  along reaction 
pathways
Supports  multi-generation 
degradation
Ensures  true conservation  of mass
Identifies  exact mass flow across 
network

Conclusion:  Smarter  Mass Balance,  Stronger  Decisions
Traditional  MB is static and blind to uncertainty.
CIMB++  transforms  MB into a predictive,  risk-aware,  and 
explainable  framework.
From LK-IMB to CIMB++,  we now:
Correct  degradant  bias (RRF,  MW, Stoichiometry) 
Quantify  uncertainty (CI, Bayesian  updating)
Make smarter  choices  (ROC thresholds,  adaptive  matrix) 
Visualize  impact  (Dashboards,  lifecycle  traceability)
Evolved  MB from  a number  to a narrative.
We didnΓÇÖt  just patch  a metric  ΓÇö we evolved  it.
LetΓÇÖs  make  mass  balance  intelligent.
